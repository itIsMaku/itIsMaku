# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
Hi, I'm Adam, but you can call me maku. I am a passionate programmer with experience in both commercial and open-source projects. Over the years, I have developed a solid foundation in Java, utilizing frameworks like Spring Boot for RESTful services. My journey began with extensive work on Minecraft projects using SpigotAPI, Bungee, and other related software, where I had the opportunity to contribute to major local projects like QPlay.cz or Matherion.

Currently, my primary expertise lies in the CitizenFX Framework (FiveM), which I engage with daily for both commercial projects at rcore.cz and leisure projects at TROR.eu. For personal projects, I leverage TypeScript alongside Next.js and React.

Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience with various database technologies, including SQL databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, as well as NoSQL solutions such as Redis and RabbitMQ. Additionally, I am well-versed in Docker and CI technologies.
